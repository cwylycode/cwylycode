<h2>âš¡ About âš¡</h2>

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is !name! and I'm just a guy who likes to code and solve problems that computers need help with - if only for my own machinations (usually). When I'm not busy making useful/awesome/bizarre apps and such, I like to browse the internet, play video games, and (gasp!) go outside. Take a look around at my GitHub repositories - you might find stuff you'll like! ðŸ˜„

These are the languages, software, and frameworks I've used over time with varing degrees of proficiency. I've worked with hardware such as the RaspberryPi and used them for electronics projects and have even run servers for personal use off of them. I also have a decent background in **Game Development**, **Office Software**, **IT Technical Support** and **Pentesting/Hacking**.
